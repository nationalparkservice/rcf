# Reproducible Climate Futures (rcf)

## Overview

[Amber to fill in need for divergent, plausible, relevant CFs, with citation to Lawrence et al. for justification for this approach and methodology. Include brief description of 3 approaches for generating CFs and when they should be used.]

This package aims to make acquiring and working with CMIP5 [MACA v2-METDATA](http://www.climatologylab.org/maca.html) downscaled climate data faster and easier and to provide a number of summary statistics that can be used to visualize different climate futures. Ultimately, having access to this data supports planning efforts that aim to incorporate climate change.

## Installation

Until approval on CRAN, you should download the development version of `rcf`

You can install the released version of rcf from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nationalparkservice/rcf")
```
<!-- Once CRAN is approved, provide instructions for installation from CRAN, for now commented out -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("rcf") -->
<!-- ``` -->



```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rcf)
```

## Usage
The first step in creating climate futures is downloading downscaled climate data for your location of interest. This package uses the [cft package](https://github.com/earthlab/cft), created by the North Central Climate Adaptation Science Center and EarthLab. Data can be downloaded from a specific point by inputing coordinates into the `rcf_data()` function. If you would like to download and summarize spatial explicit data (i.e. from multiple grid cells) or would like more information on the cft package, there is a detailed vignette on the project GitHub page. 

_Note: check for cft package updates periodically._

 Depending on internet connections and processing power, download time for a single grid cell averages about 80 minutes. The simplest and fastest method for generating climate futures is to download a single grid cell using the `rcf_data()` function.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
# raw_data <- rcf_data(SiteID = "BAND",
#                      latitude = 35.75758546,
#                      longitude = -106.3054344,
#                      units = "imperial")
```

Data used in this vignette can be downloaded [here](https://irmadev.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2286572) and read in using the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data_file_location <- "Directory where you stored data"
raw_data <- read.csv(paste0(raw_file_location,"/BAND.csv"))

```

```{r, include=FALSE}
raw_data <- read_csv(here::here("BAND.csv"))
```



Calculate threshold values using `calc_thresholds()` and summarize them by month, season or year as well as by quadrant or the most extreme model in each quadrant using `cf_quadrant()`.

```{r}
thresholds <- calc_thresholds("BAND", data = raw_data, units = "imperial")

quadrant_year <- cf_quadrant("BAND", data = thresholds, future_year = 2040, summarize_by = "year", method = "quadrant")
```

From here we can use `ggplot2` to visualize any variables and how they compare between the 4 climate futures as well as between past and future.

```{r, fig.width=15, fig.height=9, out.width="110%"}
quadrant_year_future <- quadrant_year %>%
filter(time %in% c("Future"))

ggplot(data = quadrant_year_future, aes(x = cf, y = freeze_thaw)) +
geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.4,
             aes(color = cf, fill = cf)) +
geom_jitter(alpha = 0.7,
            aes(color = cf, fill = cf)) +
scale_fill_viridis_d() +
scale_color_viridis_d() +
  labs(y = "Number of days per year",
       title = "Days that have a freeze thaw cycle by climate future") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank()) +
  theme_minimal()
```
